# City Generator
This is a python program for generating random cities and is still under development.

## Usage
In your terminal, go to folder `City_Generator`, run
```
python ./main.py
```

## Sample Output Image
A sample output image could look like this. I used two circle maps and one rectangle map as influence maps.
